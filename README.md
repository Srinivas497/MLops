## 1. Problem Statement

The curriculum-industry skill-gap problem focuses on identifying whether students possess the academic, technical, and industry-oriented skills required for employment.

This project uses a curriculum-industry skill alignment dataset containing student academic information, technical skills, professional indicators, internship experience, certifications, projects, placement information, and an industry-readiness target.

The objective of this assignment is to convert the processed curriculum-industry dataset into a simple **Feast-based feature store**.

Feast is used to:

* Define reusable features
* Retrieve historical features for machine-learning training
* Materialize features into an online store
* Retrieve online features for inference
* Use the same feature definitions for prediction

The complete workflow is demonstrated in the **Lab3 Feast notebook**.

The Lab3 notebook shows that the original dataset contains **100 rows and 25 columns**, with all columns containing 100 non-null values.

---

# 3. How the Dataset Entries Were Created

Each row represents a student profile.

The dataset combines:

* Academic information
* Technical skill scores
* Soft skills
* Internship experience
* Certifications
* Projects
* Placement status
* Industry-readiness status

The dataset was created to represent the relationship between curriculum-level skills and industry-readiness indicators.

---

# 4. Project Workflow

The project follows the following end-to-end workflow:

                    Prediction
```

---

# 5. Feature Engineering

The Lab3 notebook performs feature engineering on the preprocessed dataset before creating the Feast feature dataset.

## 5.1 Student ID

The original `Student_ID` values such as `S001`, `S002`, etc. are converted to integer `student_id` values.

Example:

```text
S001 -> 1
S002 -> 2
S003 -> 3
```

---

## 5.2 Gender Encoding

The `Gender` column is encoded as:

```text
Male   -> 0
Female -> 1
```

The resulting feature is:

```text
gender_encoded
```

---

## 5.3 Skill Count

`skill_count` counts how many of the following six technical skills have a score greater than 5:

* Programming
* DSA
* DBMS
* OS
* CN
* OOP

The calculation is:

```text
skill_count =
    (Programming > 5) +
    (DSA > 5) +
    (DBMS > 5) +
    (OS > 5) +
    (CN > 5) +
    (OOP > 5)
```

This produces an integer representing the number of selected technical skills in which the student scored above 5.

---

## 5.4 Placement Encoding

The original `Placement_Status` is converted into:

```text
Placed     -> 1
Not Placed -> 0
```

The resulting Feast feature is:

```text
is_placed
```

---

## 5.5 CGPA and Programming

The notebook converts:

```text
CGPA        -> cgpa
Programming -> programming
```

Both features are stored as `Float32`.

---

## 5.6 Industry Readiness Target

The target is encoded as:

```text
Not Ready -> 0
Ready     -> 1
```

and stored separately as:

```text
industry_readiness
```

This target is used for model training and is **not included as a FeatureView feature**.

---

# 6. Difference Between Original Dataset and Feature Dataset

The original dataset contains **25 raw columns**, including academic, technical, soft-skill, internship, certification, project, placement, and target information.

The Feast feature dataset is a smaller, model-ready dataset containing:

```text
student_id
event_timestamp
created_timestamp
semester
gender_encoded
cgpa
programming
skill_count
is_placed
```

The target:

```text
industry_readiness
```

is kept separately as the label for historical feature retrieval and model training.

Therefore, the feature dataset is a transformed and reduced representation of the original dataset designed specifically for reusable feature-store and machine-learning operations.

---

# 7. Feast Entity

The Feast entity is:

```text
student
```

with the join key:

```text
student_id
```

The entity is defined as:

```python
student = Entity(
    name="student",
    join_keys=["student_id"],
    description="CSE student"
)
```

The entity uniquely identifies each student and allows Feast to associate feature values with the correct student.

---

# 8. Feast Data Source

The Feast data source is a `FileSource`:

```python
curriculum_source = FileSource(
    name="curriculum_source",
    path="data/curriculum_features.parquet",
    timestamp_field="event_timestamp",
    created_timestamp_column="created_timestamp"
)
```

The engineered feature data is stored in:

```text
data/curriculum_features.parquet
```

The `event_timestamp` is used for point-in-time historical feature retrieval.

---

# 9. Feast FeatureView

The FeatureView is:

```text
curriculum_features
```

It is associated with the `student` entity.

### Features Stored in the FeatureView

| Feature          | Data Type | Meaning                                             |
| ---------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `semester`       | Int64     | Student's semester                                  |
| `gender_encoded` | Int64     | Encoded gender                                      |
| `cgpa`           | Float32   | Student CGPA                                        |
| `programming`    | Float32   | Programming skill score                             |
| `skill_count`    | Int64     | Number of selected technical skills scoring above 5 |
| `is_placed`      | Int64     | Placement status encoded as 1/0                     |

### FeatureView Configuration

| Property | Value                 |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| Name     | `curriculum_features` |
| Entity   | `student`             |
| Online   | `True`                |
| TTL      | 50000 days            |

---

# 10. Feature Service

The notebook creates a FeatureService named:

```text
industry_readiness_service
```

It contains:

```text
curriculum_features
```

The FeatureService is used for both historical and online feature retrieval.

---

# 11. Feast Configuration

The project uses:

```text
Feast version: 0.64.0
```

The local Feast configuration uses:

* **Offline Store:** File-based offline store
* **Offline Data:** Parquet
* **Online Store:** SQLite
* **Provider:** Local

The configuration follows the local-development approach required for this assignment.

---

# 12. Feast Registration Using `feast apply`

The following command is executed in Lab3:

```bash
feast apply
```

The command completed successfully.

The output confirms that Feast created/registered:

* Project: `curriculum_industry_skill_alignment`
* Entity: `student`
* FeatureView: `curriculum_features`
* FeatureService: `industry_readiness_service`
* SQLite online table:

```text
curriculum_industry_skill_alignment_curriculum_features
```

The entity listing confirms:

```text
student    CSE student
```

The FeatureView listing confirms:

```text
curriculum_features    {'student'}    FeatureView    Yes
```

Therefore, the assignment requirement for Feast registration using `feast apply` is demonstrated.

---

# 13. Historical Feature Retrieval

Historical features are retrieved using:

```python
store.get_historical_features(
    entity_df=entity_df,
    features=feature_service
).to_df()
```

The entity dataframe contains:

```text
student_id
event_timestamp
industry_readiness
```

### First Five Label Records

| student_id | event_timestamp           | industry_readiness |
| ---------: | ------------------------- | -----------------: |
|          1 | 2025-01-01 00:00:01+00:00 |                  0 |
|          2 | 2025-01-01 00:00:02+00:00 |                  1 |
|          3 | 2025-01-01 00:00:03+00:00 |                  0 |
|          4 | 2025-01-01 00:00:04+00:00 |                  0 |
|          5 | 2025-01-01 00:00:05+00:00 |                  0 |

The resulting historical training data contains:

```text
student_id
event_timestamp
industry_readiness
semester
gender_encoded
cgpa
programming
skill_count
is_placed
```

### First Five Historical Feature Records

| student_id | semester | gender_encoded | cgpa | programming | skill_count | is_placed | industry_readiness |
| ---------: | -------: | -------------: | ---: | ----------: | ----------: | --------: | -----------------: |
|          1 |        7 |              1 | 8.43 |         3.0 |           3 |         0 |                  0 |
|          2 |        7 |              1 | 8.88 |         5.0 |           4 |         1 |                  1 |
|          3 |        7 |              0 | 8.68 |         3.0 |           3 |         0 |                  0 |
|          4 |        8 |              0 | 7.76 |         7.0 |           4 |         0 |                  0 |
|          5 |        8 |              0 | 8.84 |         9.0 |           5 |         0 |                  0 |

---

# 14. Purpose of the Offline Store

The offline store contains historical feature data.

In this project, the feature data is stored in **Parquet format** and is used by Feast for historical feature retrieval.

The offline store is useful for:

* Creating training datasets
* Historical feature retrieval
* Point-in-time correct feature retrieval
* Reusing feature definitions for model training

---

# 15. Machine-Learning Model

The historical Feast features are used as input to a **Decision Tree Classification model**.

The model-training features are:

```python
feature_columns = [
    "semester",
    "gender_encoded",
    "cgpa",
    "programming"
]
```

The target is:

```text
industry_readiness
```

The data is divided into training and testing sets using:

```python
train_test_split(
    X,
    y,
    test_size=0.20,
    random_state=42,
    stratify=y
)
```

Therefore:

* Training records: **80**
* Testing records: **20**

The final model used for the main evaluation is:

```python
DecisionTreeClassifier(
    max_depth=1,
    min_samples_split=15,
    min_samples_leaf=8,
    random_state=42
)
```

---

# 16. Model Accuracy

The actual Lab3 output is:

```text
Accuracy: 95.0 %
```

Therefore:

**Model Accuracy = 95.0%**

The model was trained using features retrieved through Feast's historical feature retrieval process.

For comparison, the earlier preprocessing notebook reported:

```text
Baseline accuracy: 0.90
Accuracy after preprocessing: 0.95
```

The preprocessing notebook used:

* 80 training records
* 20 testing records

---

# 17. Materialization into the Online Store

The following Feast command is executed in Lab3:

```bash
feast materialize \
    2025-01-01T00:00:00 \
    2025-01-02T00:00:00
```

The command successfully reports:

```text
Materializing 1 feature views
from 2025-01-01 00:00:00+00:00
to 2025-01-02 00:00:00+00:00
into the sqlite online store.
```

The materialized FeatureView is:

```text
curriculum_features
```

Therefore, the materialization requirement is demonstrated.

---

# 18. Purpose of the Online Store

The online store contains materialized feature values and allows features to be retrieved quickly for inference.

In this project, **SQLite** is used as the local online store.

The online store is useful for:

* Fast feature retrieval
* Serving features during prediction
* Providing the latest materialized feature values
* Connecting a trained model to online inference

---

# 19. Online Feature Retrieval

The notebook retrieves online features for:

```text
student_id = 25
```

using:

```python
online_features = store.get_online_features(
    features=feature_service,
    entity_rows=[
        {"student_id": 25}
    ]
).to_dict()
```

### Actual Output

```text
{
    'student_id': [25],
    'is_placed': [0],
    'semester': [7],
    'programming': [9.0],
    'gender_encoded': [0],
    'skill_count': [3],
    'cgpa': [7.059999942779541]
}
```

Displayed as a dataframe:

| student_id | is_placed | semester | programming | gender_encoded | skill_count | cgpa |
| ---------: | --------: | -------: | ----------: | -------------: | ----------: | ---: |
|         25 |         0 |        7 |         9.0 |              0 |           3 | 7.06 |

This demonstrates online feature retrieval using:

```python
get_online_features()
```

---

# 20. Final Online Prediction

The final model is trained on the complete historical dataset:

```python
final_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(
    max_depth=4,
    random_state=42
)

final_model.fit(X, y)
```

The online features for student 25 are then passed to the model.

The actual notebook output is:

```text
Predicted survival: 0
```

In the context of this project, the prediction represents:

```text
0 = Not Ready
1 = Ready
```

The notebook labels the printed output as **"Predicted survival"** due to reused code wording, but the actual target in this project is `industry_readiness`.

### Student 25 Final Prediction

| Property                     | Result        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Student ID                   | 25            |
| Predicted Industry Readiness | **Not Ready** |
| Encoded Prediction           | **0**         |

---

# 21. Additional Online Feature Output

The notebook also retrieves online features for students 10, 20, 30, and 40.

### Online Features

| student_id | is_placed | semester | programming | gender_encoded | skill_count | cgpa |
| ---------: | --------: | -------: | ----------: | -------------: | ----------: | ---: |
|         10 |         0 |        7 |        10.0 |              1 |           4 | 6.73 |
|         20 |         0 |        7 |         7.0 |              0 |           5 | 8.50 |
|         30 |         0 |        8 |         4.0 |              0 |           3 | 6.96 |
|         40 |         0 |        7 |        10.0 |              0 |           3 | 9.32 |

### Final Online Predictions

| student_id | predicted_industry_readiness |

# 22. Required Analysis Questions

## 22.1 What is the entity in your Feast implementation?

The Feast entity is:

```text
student
```

Its join key is:

```text
student_id
```

which uniquely identifies each student.

The entity definition is:

```python
student = Entity(
    name="student",
    join_keys=["student_id"],
    description="CSE student"
)
```

---

## 22.2 List the features stored in your FeatureView.

The `curriculum_features` FeatureView stores:

1. `semester`
2. `gender_encoded`
3. `cgpa`
4. `programming`
5. `skill_count`
6. `is_placed`

---

## 22.3 Explain how one feature was calculated.

The `skill_count` feature is calculated by counting how many of six selected technical skills have a score greater than 5.

The six skills are:

* Programming
* DSA
* DBMS
* OS
* CN
* OOP

For each skill, a value greater than 5 contributes 1; otherwise it contributes 0.

The calculation is:

```text
skill_count =
(Programming > 5) +
(DSA > 5) +
(DBMS > 5) +
(OS > 5) +
(CN > 5) +
(OOP > 5)
```

For example, if four of the six skills are greater than 5, the student's `skill_count` is **4**.

---

## 22.4 What is the difference between your original dataset and the feature dataset?

The original dataset contains **25 raw columns**.

The Feast feature dataset contains a smaller set of transformed, model-ready features:

```text
student_id
event_timestamp
created_timestamp
semester
gender_encoded
cgpa
programming
skill_count
is_placed
```

The target `industry_readiness` is maintained separately as the label.

The feature dataset is therefore a transformed representation designed for feature-store usage rather than a direct copy of the original dataset.

---

## 22.5 What is the purpose of the offline store?

The offline store keeps historical feature data and is used to retrieve features for model training.

In this project, the historical feature data is stored in **Parquet format**.

---

## 22.6 What is the purpose of the online store?

The online store contains materialized features and is used for fast feature retrieval during prediction.

This project uses **SQLite** as the local online store.

---

## 22.7 What is the purpose of `feast apply`?

`feast apply` registers the Feast definitions with the feature store.

In this project, it successfully created/registered:

* `student` entity
* `curriculum_features` FeatureView
* `industry_readiness_service` FeatureService
* SQLite online table

---

## 22.8 What does materialization do?

Materialization transfers feature values from the offline/historical source into the online store for a specified time range.

In this project, materialization was performed from:

```text
2025-01-01 00:00:00
```

to:

```text
2025-01-02 00:00:00
```

into the SQLite online store.

---

## 22.9 What is the advantage of retrieving features through Feast instead of manually calculating them separately during training and prediction?

Feast provides centralized and reusable feature definitions.

The same `FeatureView` and `FeatureService` can be used for:

```text
Historical Retrieval -> Model Training

Online Retrieval    -> Model Prediction
```

This reduces duplicated feature-engineering code and helps maintain consistency between training and inference.

It also provides a standard mechanism for managing historical and online feature data.

---

## 22.10 State two limitations of your current dataset.

### Limitation 1: Small Dataset

The dataset contains only **100 student records**. A dataset of this size may not represent the complete diversity of students and may limit the generalization of the machine-learning model.

### Limitation 2: Limited Real-World Industry Evidence

The current dataset contains student-level curriculum and skill indicators but does not include a large collection of continuously updated real-world industry evidence such as:

* Job-posting skill requirements
* Employer assessments
* Industry trend data

---

## 22.11 State two ways your feature store could be improved when more curriculum and industry evidence becomes available.

### Improvement 1: Add Real Industry Evidence

The feature store can incorporate:

* Job descriptions
* Employer skill requirements
* Internship evaluations
* Placement outcomes
* Industry certifications
* Current technology-demand information

### Improvement 2: Add Continuous Feature Updates

The feature store can be updated as curriculum versions and industry requirements change.

New evidence can be incorporated into the feature pipeline so that the features remain relevant to current industry expectations.

---

# 23. Training and Serving Consistency

One important advantage demonstrated by this project is that Feast provides the same feature definitions for training and serving.

```text
                 Feast FeatureView
                       |
             +---------+---------+
             |                   |
             v                   v
 get_historical_features   get_online_features
             |                   |
             v                   v
       Training Data         Prediction Data
             |                   |
             +---------+---------+
                       |
                       v
                    ML Model
```

This reduces the risk of using different feature calculations during model training and prediction.

# 26. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete basic Feast feature-store workflow for the curriculum-industry skill-gap problem.

The original 25-column student dataset was preprocessed and transformed into a smaller feature dataset containing reusable academic, demographic, technical, skill-count, and placement features.

The engineered data was stored in Parquet and registered with Feast through a `FileSource` and `FeatureView`.

The `student` entity and `student_id` join key were created, and the `curriculum_features` FeatureView was successfully registered using `feast apply`.

Historical features were retrieved using `get_historical_features()` and used to train a Decision Tree classifier.

The model achieved an accuracy of **95.0%** on the 20-record test set.

The features were then materialized into a SQLite online store and retrieved using `get_online_features()`.

For student 25, the retrieved online features produced a final industry-readiness prediction of:

```text
Not Ready (0)
```

Thus, the implementation demonstrates how Feast can provide a consistent feature pipeline between historical model training and online model inference and can serve as a foundation for a larger curriculum-industry skill alignment system.
